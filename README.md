os-newsletter-tables
====================

This plugin will create a custom post type for your newsletters, and a shortcode that creates 
a nicely formatted table including your newsletters, meta, and d download file link and image thumbnail.

To display the newsletter table, add the shortcode [newstable] to any post or page.

The Newsletter table is built with responsive CSS, so it should fit to any size column, though it 
is not recommended for usage on cell phones in this beta version.

This is a beta version plugin. Make sure to test it thoroughly on a development site before deploying it on a live site.
OrgSpring is not responsible for the damage to or loss of any data to your site through the usage of this plugin.
