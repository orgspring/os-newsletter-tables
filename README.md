OS Newsletter Tables
====================

This plugin will create a custom post type for your newsletters, and a shortcode that creates 
a nicely formatted table including your newsletters, meta, and d download file link and image thumbnail.


Instructions
====================

To display the newsletter table, add the shortcode [newstable] to any post or page.

The Newsletter table is built with responsive CSS, so it should fit to any size column, though it 
is not recommended for usage on cell phones in this beta version.

The Newsletter Custom Post Type [osnt_newsletter] has several fields and meta associated with it. The title is the normal
post level field. All other post editing fields have been removed. In their place were put custom fields and meta boxes
to store newsletter information.


Acknowledgements

and meta boxes. For more information on Advnaced cusom fields please visit: http://www.advancedcustomfields.com.
